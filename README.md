- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

I used Flexbox to built this QR code component card as it was very easy to place the elements around.
But i will continue learning more about Flexbox to be able to build complex projects and learn about CSS Grid.


### Useful resources

-(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped understand a lot about the properties of Flexbox, it helped me align and give space to the elements the way I wanted to. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
